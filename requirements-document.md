Project Name: OnlyClowns

Business Context: Profesional Clowns, Amateur Clowns, Party Clowns and soon-to-be clowns to be able to find a love of their life that shares the same interests.

Problem Statement: It is hard for clowns to meet each other, if someone hires a clown for a party they have no need to hire a second so the clowns have no chance to meet. Non-clowns may not take them seriously.

The project serves to help clowns to avoid having to sift through other dating apps/forums that are full of non-clowns and to meet a group of people that share the same interests of clowning around. Easy to meet other clowns.

Non-Functional Requirements: 
    App:
    Not only through browser, but also a desktop and mobile app for both android and IOS/MacOS. 
    Maintainability:
    System can be "let loose", or require little upkeep from us as a team, especially with scale. We should be able to handle many users smoothly. 
    Security:
    Method of security/user verification (no clownfish here). This could include email verification, direct verificaiton of ID cards, or image verification.
