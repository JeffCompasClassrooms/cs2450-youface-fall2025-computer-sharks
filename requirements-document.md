Project Name: OnlyClowns

Business Context: Proffesional Clowns, Amateur Clowns, Party Clowns and soon to be clowns to be able to find a love of their life that shares the same interests.

Problem Statement: It is hard for clowns to meet, if someone hires a clown for a party they have no need to hire a second so the clowns have no chance to meet.

The project serves to help clowns to avoid having to sift through other dating apps/forums that are full of non-clowns and to meet a group of people that share the same interests of clowning around. Easy to meet other clowns.
