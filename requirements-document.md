### Project Name: OnlyClowns

### Business Context

 Profesional Clowns, Amateur Clowns, Party Clowns and soon-to-be clowns to be able to find a love of their life that shares the same interests.

### Problem Statement 

    It is hard for clowns to meet each other, if someone hires a clown for a party they have no need to hire a second so the clowns have no chance to meet. Non-clowns may not take them seriously.

The project serves to help clowns to avoid having to sift through other dating apps/forums that are full of non-clowns and to meet a group of people that share the same interests of clowning around. Easy to meet other clowns.

## Scope  
This app will connect and allow clowns from all over to converse and find the person who stole their squeaky nose.  

### Will Do  
- Create and edit accounts  
- Database for persistence  
- Admin for management  
- User searching *  
- Available on web browser

### Features

Clowns are gonna be able to create their profile like a dating app and their talents as professional clowns. They can upload any pictures of what they do.

In every profile there is gonna be a match feature to show them with who they match the most with someone else.

The records will be kept in a file for each profile with ultra security system.

The system will interface with the management system to intervene in the match if there is something wrong going on or thelp them by giving it some advice to lead the relationship to another level.Relationships advice. Marriage!!!!

It is gonna be a realistic website. We are gonna detect any information upload that uses an AI to create a false profile.

If someone creates a false profile will be sentenced to pay an amount of money for lying and going against the law of the website or kick out from the website for life.

The text messages will have mini-games.

Clowns can work together by sharing their location.

Clowns will have the ability to select their preference of clown, ie gender, hair color, nose, talents and shoe size

Speed dating events where during a specific time during the week clowns can have 5-10 minute live discussions with other clowns.

There will be a most compatible feature that shows the most compatible clown based on features and interests.

Profile prompts to make profiles interesting and spicy >:)

Clown horn, a feature that is a special note sent to a clown that one finds so irresistable that they can send a message regardless if they have matched yet.

This is a small change

### Non-Functional Requirements: 
    App:
    Not only through browser, but also a desktop and mobile app for both android and IOS/MacOS. 
    Maintainability:
    System can be "let loose", or require little upkeep from us as a team, especially with scale. We should be able to handle many users smoothly. 
    Security:
    Method of security/user verification (no clownfish here). This could include email verification, direct verificaiton of ID cards, or image verification.
