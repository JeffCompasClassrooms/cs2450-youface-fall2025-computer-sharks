Project Name: OnlyClowns

Business Context: Profesional Clowns, Amateur Clowns, Party Clowns and soon-to-be clowns to be able to find a love of their life that shares the same interests.

Problem Statement: It is hard for clowns to meet, if someone hires a clown for a party they have no need to hire a second so the clowns have no chance to meet. Non-clowns may not take them seriously.

Scope:  This app will connect and allow clowns from all over to converse and find the person who stole their squeeky nose.
Will do:
    Create and edit accounts
    Database for persistance
    Admin for management
    User searching *
    Available on web browser
    Available on app stores *

Wont do:
    Multi language
    Calling or video calling

# * mean not part of MVP (minimum viable product)

Assumptions: 
* This app will run on modern web browsers as well as have an app for IOS and Android.
* Internet access is a must.
* Users will have to have access to a camera of some sort for photos.
* Users will make an account.
* The third party stuff (DB) we use continues to be available.
* Server will keep running.
* Users will be able to navigate a web page semi proficiently

Features:

Non-Functional Requirements: 
    App:
    Not only through browser, but also a desktop and mobile app for both android and IOS/MacOS. 
    Maintainability:
    System can be "let loose", or require little upkeep from us as a team, especially with scale. We should be able to handle many users smoothly. 
    Security:
    Method of security/user verification (no clownfish here). This could include email verification, direct verificaiton of ID cards, or image verification.
